# leaflet-challenge
Module 15 Challenge for Vanderbilt Data Analytics December 2023

The live dashboard is located at https://dlerhetal.github.io/leaflet-challenge/

There are 4 files and 4 folders located in this repository, as follows:

This README text file, 1 index.html file, 1 logic.js file, 1 style.css file, 1 Leaflet-Part-1 folder, 1 static folder, 1 js folder, and 1 css folder.

Special Recognition: Ahmad Mousa is as passionate and caring as he is knowledgeable, and Joshua Steier never hesitates to help walk us through challenges. 

I always do participate in office hours and study groups while working on projects with collaborators including but not necessarily limited to the following peers: Ilknur Sekmen, Justin Ibeh, Karson Kosek, Kiara Shannon, Luisa Dinwiddie, Margo Berry, Morgan Escue, Morgan Foge, Nathan Johnson, William Brewer, Andrew Clifft, Angela Reed, and Josh Gibson, and I did spend my time in stackoverflow.com, w3schools.com, geeksforgeeks.com, github.com, and plotly.com; however, the bootcamp has added a new Xpert Learning Assistant, and my life is now complete. Thank you for this resource!
